# 10 Popular packages in python

1.TensorFlow

This library was developed by Google in collaboration with Brain Team.
TensorFlow is used in almost every Google application for machine learning.
It is a open source library.TensorFlow is optimized for speed,it makes use 
of techniques like XLA for quick linear algebra operations.It works like a
computational library for writing new algorithms that involve a large 
number of tensor operations.

2.Scikit-learn

It is a Python library is associated with NumPy and SciPy. It is considered
as one of the best libraries for working with complex data.
There are a lot of changes being made in this library. One modification
is the cross-validation feature, providing the ability to use more than 
one metric.it contains a numerous number of algorithms for implementing 
standard machine learning and data mining tasks like reducing dimensionality,
classification, regression, clustering, and model selection. 

3.Keras

Keras is considered as one of the coolest machine learning libraries in Python.
It provides an easier mechanism to express neural networks. Keras also provides
some of the best utilities for compiling models, processing data-sets, 
visualization of graphs, and much more.

4.PyTorch

PyTorch is the largest machine learning library that allow developers to perform
tensor computations wan ith acceleration of GPU, creates dynamic computational graphs
,and calculate gradients automatically. Other than this, PyTorch offers rich APIs
for solving application issues related to neural network.

5.LightGBM

Gradient Boosting is one of the best and most popular machine learning library, 
which helps developers in building new algorithms by using redefined elementary
models and namely decision trees. Therefore, there are special libraries which
are designed for fast and efficient implementation of this method.these libraries
are LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost

6.Eli5

Most often the results of machine learning model predictions are not accurate, 
and Eli5 machine learning library built in Python helps in overcoming this challenge.
It is a combination of visualization and debug all the machine learning models and 
track all working steps of an algorithm.

7.SciPy

SciPy is a machine learning library for application developers and engineers.
SciPy is a library that uses NumPy for the purpose of solving mathematical functions.
this uses NumPy arrays as the basic data structure, and comes with modules for various 
commonly used tasks in scientific programming.
Tasks including linear algebra, integration (calculus), ordinary differential equation
solving and signal processing are handled easily by SciPy.

8.Theano

Theano is a computational framework machine learning library in Python for computing
multidimensional arrays. Theano works similar to TensorFlow, but it not as efficient
as TensorFlow. Because of its inability to fit into production environments.Moreover,
Theano can also be used on a distributed or parallel environments just similar to
TensorFlow.

9.XGBoost

XGBoost is an algorithm that has recently been dominating for structured or tabular data.
XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and
performance.

10.Lightning

The name "Lightning" is simply a reference to the Open Watcom logo.It is incomplete
It does not imply this implementation is any faster than stock Python. In fact, it is
consdierably slower at the moment.Lightning Python is an alternate build of Python
for Microsoft Windows and Linux using the Open Watcom compiler.
